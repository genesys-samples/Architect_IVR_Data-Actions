## Data Source Configuration

At its most basic form, the concept of an agent script is simply a visual display that assists an agent in any form. This can be as simple as providing a single line of text that tells an agent how to greet a customer - "Thanks for calling the best company ever, do you have an existing case or are you calling about a new issue?"

In this section we will explore how we can use data sources to provide a truly unique experience to an individual customer. We will start by constructing a basic data table, populating it with powerful information that is **specific to our customer** and move into a simple data action that will allow agents to update customer details on the fly.

While we will be building and referencing data that is stored local to the platform, the concepts apply to any external data source, such as popular CRM's or any home brewed application with a RESTful API.


### Welcome! In this section, we will cover the construction of an internal data source as well as an external data source.
