## Building your Script

So we've got a data source constructed and we're ready to present all of this incredibly meaningful information to our agents, but how does the script know this data exists? How do we construct the building blocks that this information needs to plug into?? Most importantly (the question you're all asking yourselves), **how do we make it look pretty?**

In this section we will cover -
  * Containers and Formatting - How do we align and store configuration elements in a method that is presentable and easy to consume?
  * Configuration Elements - What constructors are available? How do we add and utilize different scriptor building blocks?
  * Variables - How do we receive, store, or transfer information within the scripting interface?
  * Actions - How do we allow agents to pull from or update the data source we constructed or other external data sources with the click of a button? 

  We will close out by creating a simple architect flow that will serve as a basic means of testing the script we constructed before we lead into part 2 of the workshop.
