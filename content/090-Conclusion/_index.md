# Conclusion

This entire workshop has been leading us up to part 2 of the **Meaningful Interactions** series... At the most basic form, what we've learned in part 1 of this workshop series is an advanced method of simplifying our agents lives. We've constructed a data source with **Powerful** information that your agent can use, we've populated that into a script that the agent can consume, and the most powerful feature we've applied is allowing your agent to interact with and update this data without leaving the platform.

 Everything we've looked at can be simplified by using static information instead of variables... Empowering your agents doesn't start at script actions and data source lookups, it starts at changing these variables into static values.
 
 The knowledge base URL, and at a base level, all of the tooling can be hard coded to show every agent the same information, which is information that isn't so readily available on other platforms.

 This workshop leads us into part 2, where we will learn how we can use Architect and routing to enhance this experience and target the appropriate audience.
