# The Art of Creating Meaningful Interactions - Part 1

## What is the Goal of this Workshop?

The goal of part 1 of this 2 part workshop series is to show how we can utilize scripts to provide incredibly powerful tools to the agents with minimal effort. By the end we will have constructed and tested an agent script that will provide interactive maps, knowledge base articles and allow for agents to update a fake customer record. The target audience is anyone 

We will walk through a simple data source construction as well as an understanding of the scripting interface to introduce the basic concepts required to make more advanced scripts. We will move into custom script actions to showcase at a intermediate level how to we can use scripts to allow our agents to execute powerful functions such as updating customer records.

## Who is the Target Audience?

The target audience of this workshop is anyone new to the agent script interface, particularly prospective or onboarding customers that want to learn how we can leverage a powerful native tool to begin assisting our agents and improving our the experience for our customers.

## How do you define a meaningful interaction?

Lets start at the base level: **Interaction** - Very simply defined as communication or direct involvement with someone or something.

From the contact center perspective, we can narrow this down to a customer interacting with a platform, a bot, an agent, or any other media they can consume. For this workshop we'll define an interaction as an engagement between a customer and an agent, after all, its simple to provide a bot with more answers, but how do we empower our agents?

To many of us consumers, a meaningful interaction can be as simple as those heaps of data we entered into the IVR actually passing through to the agent. Simply put, we entered our account number, and the agent didn't have to ask us for it when we finally connected. They had our account up and the information we entered felt like it had meaning.

But how do we as agents, administrators or even supervisors on the other end connect to our customers at a deeper level?

Lets start by putting ourselves in the shoes of the customer. We've had our account for years, we've updated it, we've made changes, we've opened cases and most importantly - **We've interacted with it because it is us**. Why does it feel like every time we interact with someone it's the first time they've ever heard of us? Clearly, I am just an account, I'm just a metric for them that they will report on later.


Next lets set ourselves in the shoes of the agent - For anyone that has worked in a contact center as an agent, we **interact** with many customers every day, and the cause of their complaints are usually transparent to us, or out of our control. We answer a call, sometimes we don't know who's calling, but we authenticate them and attempt to fix their issue. The constant complaints of "I've already entered this into your phone system" are lost on us, we didn't build the phone system afterall and we're just here to help. We have many disparate systems and the solution from leadership is to add more monitors and tabs to keep track of who we're talking to and when.


The fact is, the issues for customers are echoed by the agents. The long hold time for a customer is derived by the long handle time of the agent. However, we can't look at the customer for hints as to why they're holding for so long, the emphasis immediately goes on the agent.

With the right resources, an agent can make meaningful connections with their customers, well beyond asking for their account number and telling them their case status...
